# ser

The goal of ser is to automate parts of the SER Communications Committee
workflow (e.g.Â posting to Twitter). This package makes it easier to do
so reproducibly and in a place where it is easier for us to collaborate
on new automated workflows.

## Installation

You can install the package off of GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SERTwitter/ser")
```

## What does ser currently do?

ser handles automatic daily tweeting to supplement the work done by
content leads, daily email summaries of Twitter activity on the SER
account, and posts tweets related to the annual meeting during the three
months prior.

  - `action_auto_tweet()`
  - `action_email_summary()`
  - `action_meeting_tweet()`

ser also provides functions to email summaries of errors that may occur
in code while running automatically on the server. `action_safely()`
wraps functions to catch errors and email them to an address set by
`on_error_email_to()`

``` r
library(ser)
on_error_email_to("your@email.com")

auto_error <- function() {
  stop("this code stopped working")
}

safe_auto_error <- action_safely(auto_error)

# sends an email to stored email address with error message
safe_auto_error()
```
